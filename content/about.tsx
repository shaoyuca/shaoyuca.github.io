 *
 * PORTRAIT ORIENTATION RECOMMENDED (taller than wide).
 * The photo is displayed at 180 × 200 px and automatically cropped from the

 * Any file size or resolution works — the site handles resizing.

    Dr. Shaoyu Cai is currently a lecturer at the Engineering Design and Innovation Centre (EDIC), 
    College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS). He also serves as Co-director in NUS Immersive Reality Lab. 
    He received his Ph.D. degree from School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong (2023). 
    His research objective is to explore how to develop “touchable” computer interfaces to enable people to have physical interaction in the virtual world. 
    He strongly believes multimodal interaction can provide greater benefit and experience to users in extended reality (XR) environments, including virtual and augmented reality (VR & AR). 
    Currently, his research interest mainly focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in the areas of Multimodal Interfaces, Immersive Reality, Wearables, and Haptic Perception.

// ── 2. RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ──────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Each entry creates one research-direction block (H2 title + description + project images).
 * You can add or remove entries freely.
 *
 * How project pages are created:
 *   1. Add a project below with a title and imageSrc.
 *   2. The image appears on the About page.
 *   3. Clicking the image automatically opens a project detail route generated
 *      from the title. Example: "Project Alpha" -> "/projects/project-alpha".
 *   4. The generated detail page currently shows the project title and
 *      "Project detail page coming soon."
 *
 * projects[].title    -> label shown below the image. Keep titles unique.
 * projects[].imageSrc -> place your image in public/images/ and write "/images/filename.jpg"
 *                        Up to 5 projects are shown per row (2 columns on mobile).
 * projects[].href     -> optional advanced override. Most projects do not need this.

 *   Place images in public/images/ and write "/images/filename.jpg" for src.
 *   Remove the entire `images` array if you don't need this row.
