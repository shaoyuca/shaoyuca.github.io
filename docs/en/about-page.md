# About Page — Customization Guide

All the text, links, and images on the About page live in **one single file**:

```
content/about.tsx
```

Open that file. Every section has comments explaining what each field does.  
You do **not** need to touch any other file.

## How to upload images

1. Place your image file in the `public/images/` folder.
2. Reference it in the config as `/images/your-filename.jpg`.

```
public/
  images/
    my-photo.jpg       ← put files here
```

```tsx
imageSrc: '/images/my-photo.jpg'   // ← write it like this
```

Any image size or format (JPG, PNG, WebP) works. The site automatically crops
every image to a consistent size so nothing ever looks stretched or misaligned.

## 1. Bio

### Changing the text

Find the `BIO_TEXT` section and rewrite between the `<>` and `</>` tags:

```tsx
export const BIO_TEXT = (
  <>
    Dr. Smith is a Professor of Computer Science at Example University...
  </>
)
```

### Adding a link inside the bio

Wrap any word with `<InlineLink>`:

```tsx
export const BIO_TEXT = (
  <>
    Dr. Smith is a Professor at{' '}
    <InlineLink href="https://example.edu" external>Example University</InlineLink>.
  </>
)
```

- `href="…"` — the URL the link points to
- `external` — add this word if the link opens an external website; remove it for links to pages on this site (e.g. `/publications`)

### Changing the profile links (Google Scholar, DBLP, etc.)

Find `BIO_LINKS` and edit the list. Add, remove, or reorder entries freely:

```tsx
export const BIO_LINKS = [
  { label: 'Google Scholar', href: 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXXX', external: true },
  { label: 'CV',             href: '/files/cv.pdf' },   // no "external" needed for internal files
]
```

## 2. Research Directions

Each entry in `RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS` creates one block with an H2 title, a description,
and a row of project images.

### Changing a title or description

```tsx
{
  title: 'My Research Area',   // ← the H2 heading
  description: 'A short paragraph describing this direction.',
  projects: [ … ],
},
```

### Adding a research direction

Copy an existing entry (including the `{ … },`) and paste it at the end of the array.

### Removing a research direction

Delete the entire `{ … },` block for that entry.

### Adding / changing project images

Each project inside `projects: [ … ]` has three fields:

```tsx
{
  title: 'Project Name',              // label shown below the image
  href: '/projects/my-project-slug',  // internal link — see note below
  imageSrc: '/images/my-project.jpg', // image file in public/images/
},
```

**Up to 5 projects** are shown per row. Any extras are ignored.

#### About `href` (the route)

The link points to a page on this site. You need to create a matching page file:

- `href: '/projects/soft-robot'` → create `app/projects/soft-robot/page.tsx`

If the page doesn't exist yet, the link still works (it will show a 404 until you create it).

## 3. Our Approach

### Changing the section title and description

```tsx
export const OUR_APPROACH = {
  title: 'Our Approach',      // ← H2 heading
  description: 'An overview sentence about your lab's philosophy.',
  items: [ … ],
}
```

### Each sub-section (H3)

```tsx
{
  title: 'Engineering & Scientific Impact',   // ← H3 heading
  description: 'A sentence about this area.',
  bullets: [
    'Plain bullet point with no link.',
    <>Bullet with a <InlineLink href="https://example.com" external>link</InlineLink> inside.</>,
  ],
},
```

- Plain text bullets: just write a string in quotes.
- Bullets with a link: use `<>…</>` and place `<InlineLink>` inside.

### The optional image row

At the bottom of `OUR_APPROACH` there is an optional `images` array for press logos,
award badges, or media features. Each image links to an external URL when clicked:

```tsx
images: [
  { src: '/images/press-logo.png', alt: 'Press logo', href: 'https://news-article-url.com' },
],
```

To **hide this row entirely**, delete the `images: [ … ],` block.

## 4. Contact

### Changing the text

```tsx
export const CONTACT = {
  title: 'Contact',
  intro: 'One or two sentences introducing your location and how to reach you.',
  description: 'Full address, office hours, and email.',
  …
}
```

### Changing the building photo

```tsx
imageSrc: '/images/my-building.jpg',   // place the file in public/images/
imageAlt: 'Description of the photo',
```

### Changing the Google Maps location

1. Go to [maps.google.com](https://maps.google.com) and search for your institution.
2. Click **Share** → **Embed a map**.
3. Copy the URL that appears inside `src="…"` (it starts with `https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=…`).
4. Paste it as the value of `mapEmbedUrl`:

```tsx
mapEmbedUrl: 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18…',
```

## Quick reference — InlineLink

Use `<InlineLink>` anywhere you want a styled hyperlink (grey text, underline, turns black on hover).

| Use case | Code |
|---|---|
| External website | `<InlineLink href="https://example.com" external>link text</InlineLink>` |
| Internal page | `<InlineLink href="/publications">link text</InlineLink>` |

`external` opens the link in a new tab and is safe for any URL outside this website.
